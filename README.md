# my_flasky
## This is a Flask project based on the tutorial of flasky book. Â 
https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky  
As I am in the learning progress of Flask, So I didn't change much of the code yet, however, I still came across a lot of issues, some of them took me much time to debug and finally, "oh!... it's a typo". And some of them are about sqlite database.  
Still, I am new to this interesting web framework, so updates will be more...
